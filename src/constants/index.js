      "I'm Abdelghany Mohamed, I live in Egypt, have a Bachelor of Commerce department in banking and financial markets management, I worked as an accountant for two years, but I wasn't very interested in the field, so I looked for an extra field, and I came across the field of graphics, I decided to learn it, took several courses and worked as a designer with a printing press and e-marketing pages, but graphics like the sea have no boundaries, so I preferred to specialize in motion graphics, If you're an agent will be happy to work with you, and if you're a student you're welcome to help.",
